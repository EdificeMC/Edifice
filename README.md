### About
Edifice is a Sponge plugin designed to help players share their personal creations with the Minecraft community. It has a [website](http://www.edificemc.com) to help players browse popular structures. 

### Usage

#### Building a structure
* Visit the [Edifice website](https://www.edificemc.com/), and browse for a structure
* Copy the structure's build command (hover over the preview or go to the structure's page)
* Paste the command into any server with Edifice installed, and press enter. You will be given a blueprint containing the data of the structure.
* Place a chest on the ground, and place an item frame on any side of the chest
* Place the blueprint in the item frame. Note that the side of the chest on which the item frame is placed will determine the direction of the structure.
 
 Your setup should look similar to this:

* Right click the chest to see the materials needed to complete the structure. To build the structure, simply throw the necessary materials near the chest.
 
#### Sharing a structure

* Type `/edifice wand` to activate the wand.
* Left and right click the corners of the structure.
 * You may use `/edifice wand expand` to expand the selection to the highest y-level containing blocks.
* Use `/edifice save <name>` to upload the structure. Note that the direction you are facing will dictate the "front" of the structure.
* Follow the link given in chat to the Edifice website. There, you can choose how your structure will look on the website.
* After uploading, return to the home page or your profile (if logged in) to see your structure.
